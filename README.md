Hi, I’m Sahil 👋  
Senior Blockchain & Full-Stack Developer

I specialize in building production-grade Web3, DeFi, and backend systems for startups and enterprises.

🔒 Note on Repositories  
Most of my professional work lives in private repositories due to:
- Client NDAs
- Proprietary trading logic
- Financial & security-sensitive smart contracts

What I Work On:
- Smart Contracts (Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat)
- DeFi systems (DEXs, Bridges, Flash Loans, Arbitrage)
- Web3 Backends (Node.js, Golang, PostgreSQL)
- Telegram Mini Apps & Bots
- Full-stack Web3 platforms (Next.js + Blockchain)

Public Showcase:
- Architecture samples
- Utility scripts
- Documentation & system designs
- Personal experiments and tooling

If you’re a recruiter or client and need code samples, I’m happy to share **select snippets or walkthroughs** privately.
